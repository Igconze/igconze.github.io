            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        </span>
        <span class="underline">
            I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.

             And I felt him to be more fragile still.
        </span>
